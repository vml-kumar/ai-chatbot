# 🤖 AI Chatbot — Full Stack Project

This project is a full-stack AI chatbot web application designed to provide real-time conversational experiences using the power of leading language models like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and Mistral via OpenRouter. The application includes user authentication, chat history saving, provider switching, and prompt suggestions for better usability. Built using a modern tech stack—React (with TypeScript), Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase Authentication—it offers a fast, scalable, and mobile-friendly interface with a clean, responsive UI.

The system is designed with a modular codebase that separates concerns across frontend and backend, follows a scalable folder structure, and leverages Redux Toolkit for global state management. Users can log in to save their chat history or continue chatting as guests. The chat interface automatically displays prompt suggestions for first-time users or users without history, enhancing the user experience with intuitive AI guidance.
